  This inserts the "about" photo and text from `_config.yml`.
  You can edit it there (jekyll needs restart!) or remove it and provide your own photo/text.

Hi! I'm Ashley! I'm originally from Tennessee, but recently became a Texas immigrant. I've been working in customer service/support all my life for brands leading the way in exceptional customer experiences. Outside of work, books are my friends, yoga keeps me centered, and bougie food makes me happy. I help my husband brew beer and he helps me explore my tech curiosity. My travel bug bites me every couple of months, so you will see me hunting for flight deals like a madwoman.
