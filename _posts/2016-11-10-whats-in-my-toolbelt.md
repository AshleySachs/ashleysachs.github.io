When I first sat down to write this post for the [Support Driven Writing Challenge](https://supportdriven.com/2016/10/21/stretch-your-typing-fingers-support-driven-6-week-writing-challenge/) I knew I was going to struggle. What the heck am I going to write about? My technical support tools are not exactly cutting edge and require a lot of work arounds. I don't have the cool gadgets and a powerful machine like my super techie husband, so I decided to think about to the things that make me me and help me accomplish my daily goals. 

#Planning with Passion
I confess, I am one of those people that will never let go of pen and paper. No matter how cool and mobile tech gets, I don't think I will ever give it up. The conversation of making our grocery list with Google Keep rather than my trusty magnetic notepad on the fridge is a monthly battle between my husband and I. This love for pen and paper led me to find the [Passion Planner](http://www.passionplanner.com/). I needed something to structure my days and my thoughts. I felt unfocused and scatterbrained and this little jewel helped me find my way. It encouraged me to nail down a goal for 2016, practicing being present. Did I reach it? Heck no, but I was constantly reminded every week to be present and it made me find my groove with my next tool. 

#Saturday Mornings
I love books. Rory Gilmore is my spirit person, I have no clue how she carried so many physical books around with her since I cheat with the Kindle app. A lot of people love their Saturday mornings because they get to sleep in. I love my Saturday mornings because it is my chance to escape my current reality and engage in an exciting world that an incredibly talented person has thought up. Allowing myself to escape into a different time and place keeps me calm and fulfills my human need for rest.  Currently my fall Saturdays consist of being up before 9:00 (hey, I sleep in a little) a cup of [Cuvee](http://www.cuveecoffee.com/), below 65 degree temps on my patio with the wind chimes going, and the latest NY times best seller. 

#Ted Talks
Do you love being inspired? Let me re-phrase that, are you addicted to being inspired? Because I am. The best way I have found to fulifll this addiction: [Ted Talks](https://www.ted.com/talks). Ted Talks have introduced me to facinating people that speak about incredible things. My addiction started with a Ted Talk talk by Dr. Brene Brown (embedded below for your enjoyment). After watching it, I was instantly e-mailing the link to my old co-workers back in Tennesse and talking to my teammates at my current job about the importance of vunerability. My love and appreciation for Ted Talks has extended to my current team where we have monthly meetings where we watch a 15 to 20 minute talk and have an open discussion. That time has allowed us to explore new concepts in the workplace and learn about the successes and failures of amazing people.

#Whole Foods Dates
Allow me to stand on my soapbox for a moment. Rest is vital to the human body and mind. I don't mean just getting the sixish hours of sleep you need to physically operate. I am talking about your disconnect time, your "I'm going to sit here and enjoy the moment" time. I do that at Whole Foods with my husband. We have a Whole Foods equipped with an expansive salad bar, pizza oven, sandwhich shop, coffee stand and pub. Everything about this Whole Foods is inviting and it allows us to sit and rest with good food and drink. I find my peace and calm amongst the cheese, wine, and decadent canolis they make at the pastry counter. Call it silly, but I find my rest at Whole Foods and that rest completes my tool belt.
