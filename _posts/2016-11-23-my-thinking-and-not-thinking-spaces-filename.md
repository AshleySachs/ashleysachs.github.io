## My Thinking and Not Thinking Spaces
​
This is yet another challenging post for me as part of the [Support Driven Writing Challenge](https://supportdriven.com/2016/10/21/stretch-your-typing-fingers-support-driven-6-week-writing-challenge/), because (and this is me being completely honest) I am not a fan of thinking spaces. As a recovering workaholic and over achiever, thinking too much can cause anxiety for me. Don't get me wrong, I think it is important to plan, strategize and reflect. However, for me I need to have a defined time a place for those things balanced with a time when I don't have to think. Borrowing from [Gallup's Strengths Finder](http://strengths.gallup.com/default.aspx), welcome to the mind of a responsible, disciplined achiever that likes consistency and harmony.

### When I need to get it done
I am my most effective in my "plugged in state". My noise cancelling headphones on, [Fall Morning](https://open.spotify.com/user/ashleysachs/playlist/1iLKmaqmrMFdiXr8gaWfk4) Spotify Playlist going (no matter what season), and a to do list in front of me. My most focused time outside of the work has to be in the sanctuary of a coffee shop. I don't know if it is the unlimited supply of caffeine, the overwhelming feeling of intellect bustling around, or just simply that I won't be judged for being antisocial with my computer in front of me. Coffee shops allow me a place to disconnect and drown out the distractions around me.
​
### When I need to work through it
Like I said before, too much thinking space isn't a good thing for me. But there are times when I need it to work through the hard things and just like any Type A personality, I like a structured space to work through life's craziness. When something is particularly heavy or a situation is too complicated to work out in the quiet of the coffee shop, I hit the pavement with my running shoes on. While a lot of people say that running helps clear their head, running is the exact opposite for me. It makes me think and allows me to work through my day in a mental and physical way. One of my biggest blessings is the gym at my office. Getting on the treadmill during my lunch break has rescued me during some pretty hard times whether it be working on an impossible technical situation, fighting impostor syndrome, or reflecting on some heavy feedback. After a run, whether it be 15 minutes or 45 (definitely not a true runner), I always feel a sense of completion, both mentally and physically. Whether I have found the answer to my problem at mile 2 or come up with an action plan, my confidence is restored and I’m ready to face whatever life has for me.

### When I need to forget about it
​
Now for my not thinking space. Believe it or not, my thinking exercises during my runs led me to the realization that you can have too much of a good thing. I was trying to run daily and I found out very quickly that my anxiety level was rising dramatically. Yes, there was a lot going on in life. I stayed continually busy with my work and was having a hard time setting up boundaries. However, trying to work through all these things during a run made me feel like I was drowning. I had to tell myself that I didn't have to spend every hour of every day being productive and that restful mind is just as important. I found my peace and quiet like may others: on the yoga mat. Yoga was an escape for me because I was forced to shift my focus during practice. I couldn't think about the 15 things I had to accomplish after leaving the mat, I had to make sure my body was in the right position, that I was breathing right, and my balance was just so. I'll go ahead and break blog code and quote Dr. Brene Brown a second post in a row:

I encourage you to find your thinking space but also your not thinking space. Make sure you are making time not just for your body to rest, but your mind to rest also (and please don't always resort to Netflix to do so.)
