## How I support my customers


After working for Rackspace for almost three years, I have come to learn very well that the tools and mediums by which you support your customer can make or break the customer experience. If you are successful in the mediums by which you help your customer then of course your customer is going to be successful. Here is some things I feel my team does well and some areas of improvent that would give us a chance to grow. 

# We have the fanatical voice 

The Rackspace brand prides itself on always being able to reach us by phone 24 hours a day 365 days a year and boy do we know how to answer the phone. Everyone of my teammates has that what we like to call "audible smile" and we know how to use.
