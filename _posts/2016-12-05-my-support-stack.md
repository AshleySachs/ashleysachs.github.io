## How I support my customers


After working for Rackspace for almost three years, I have come to learn very well that the tools and mediums by which you support your customer can make or break the customer experience. If you are successful in the mediums by which you help your customer then of course your customer is going to be successful. It's also the strength in these mediums that can turn an interaction into a remarkable experience of a customer. Here is some things I feel my team does well and some areas of improvent that would give us a chance to grow. 

# We have the fanatical voice 

The Rackspace brand prides itself on always being able to reach us by phone 24 hours a day 365 days a year and boy do we know how to answer the phone. Everyone of my teammates has that what we like to call "audible smile" and we know how to use. To say that there is a strong aversion to calling support for a lot of customers is an understatement. I have to talk to some customers that absolutely loathe having to pick up the phone, and I get it, stuff should just work. However, if you have to call support, it should be a pleasant experience. That audible smile is what helps put customers at ease when they call and ensues a level of trust so they are confident that their probably is going to get solved. 

# Ticket crunchers

Just like all major service providers, tickets are make up a huge portion of our support volume. We have the ticketing system integrated with our homegrown CRM so it makes keeping up to date with the customers communication and issues easy and allows us to create ticket straight from the CRM if an escalation is needed. The only down fall I would like to see improved with our ticket system is a little .gif integration. 

# What we could do better

While this is not true for all departments, my team especially has an odd aversion to video calls. In my opinion I feel like they can definitely help bridge the gap of making a transaction an interaction. Can we have video calls with every one of our customers? Of course not, but it is definitely something we can do with the larger spend accounts especially during the onboarding process. With the amazing tools we have in the technology world today like Hangouts, Skype, Zoom, Appear.in. Why not take advantage of the these resources and better the customer experience?
