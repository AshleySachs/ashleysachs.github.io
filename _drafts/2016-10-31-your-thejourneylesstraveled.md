## The Journey Less Traveled

I read a lot growing up. I still do, but of course, when you are younger everyone reads the same thing because it's what you do in school. I'm sure you have read "The Lord of the Flies" by William Golding and "Animal Farm" by George Orwell. Along the same lines, we have all come across the same poems, like "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost. When I was younger I was obsessed with this poem because I thought it spoke to my desire for travel. Call it cliche, but I still identify with this poem in a major way, for what I think Frost meant it to be for: a journey that you didn't expect and weren't too sure about. 

My academic and career background couldn't be more different than what I am doing now. I became intrigued by the human body and death at a young age, stay with me, when I was in highschool and taking basic anatomy. I read as many fictional and true crime books I could get my hands on and loved learning about the science behind finding out "who dun it". I knew going into college this is what I wanted to do. I wanted to be a medical examiner and speak for the dead through the wonders of the human body. I finished college pre-med and realized that my heart wasn't ready for full blown med school, that and I hated chemistry. I took the journey back to my home town of Knoxville, Tennesse, home to the best forensic anthropology in the country with skeletons located in the basement of the football stadium (yes, that part of The Blind Side is true). I worked for two years to get into the graduate program taking classes, volunteering at the Body Farm, and working at Chick-fil-A to pay for my school bills. One day while processing a skeleton fresh from the farm, I realized that this life wasn't my passion. I enjoyed it yes, but it lacked fulfillment for me and I felt like I would get in a situation where I would never be able to disconnect. This was diffently not what I wanted for my future self or the family I hoped to have one day. 

Cue the first road divergence in my life that Frost talks about: I could have gone ahead and started the job hunt from scratch, turned back to school for a differnet degree, or take the unusual road: keep working for Chick-fil-A. I went from being a team member, to running shifts at the restaurants, to a director position in marketing for three stores.  It wasn't always glorious and boy did you smell terrible after a shift, but I learned some of the most valuable things at Chick-fil-A that I carry with me today.   

First: Servant Leadership - I learned what it was like to work WITH people as a leader, not have people work for me. I was exposed to an environment that cultivated personal growth and encouraged personal best. 

Second: Loving People - There is something about being completely understaffed late at night after a Georgia/UT football game, on the verge of tears, and having a customer look at you with a smile and say "It's cool. I know you all are trying your best. Waiting 15 minutes for my food is cool".
