## The Journey Less Traveled


I read a lot growing up. I still do, but of course, when you are younger everyone reads the same thing because it's what you do in school. I'm sure you have read "The Lord of the Flies" by William Golding and "Animal Farm" by George Orwell. Along the same lines, we have all come across the same poems, like "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost. When I was younger I was obsessed with this poem because I thought it spoke to my desire for travel. Call it cliche, but I still identify with this poem in a major way, for what I think Frost meant it to be for: a journey that you didn't expect and weren't too sure about. 

### "You went to school for what?"
My academic and career background couldn't be more different than what I am doing now. I became intrigued by the human body and death at a young age, stay with me, when I was in highschool and taking basic anatomy. I read as many fictional and true crime books I could get my hands on, and loved learning about the science behind finding out "who dun it". I knew going into college this is what I wanted to do. I wanted to be a medical examiner and speak for the dead through the wonders of the human body. I graduated college as pre-med and realized that my heart wasn't ready for full blown med school, and I simply hated chemistry. I took the journey back to my hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee. Knoxville is home to the best forensic anthropology in the US, with skeletons located in the basement of the football stadium (yes, that part of The Blind Side is true). I worked for two years to get into their graduate program taking classes, volunteering at the [Body Farm](http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/body-farm-sci), and working at Chick-fil-A to pay for my school bills. One day while processing a skeleton fresh from the farm, I realized that this life wasn't my passion. I enjoyed it yes, but it lacked fulfillment for me and I felt like I was moving into a career where I would never be able to disconnect. This was definitely not what I wanted for my future self or the family I hoped to have one day. 

### What I learned frying chicken
Cue the first road divergence in my life that Frost talks about: I could have gone ahead and started the job hunt from scratch, turned back to school for a different degree, or take the unusual road: keep working for Chick-fil-A. I went from being a team member, to running shifts at the restaurants, to a director position in marketing for three stores.  It wasn't always glorious and boy did I smell terrible after a shift, but I learned some of the most valuable things at Chick-fil-A that I carry with me today.   


First: Servant Leadership - I learned what it was like to work WITH people as a leader, not have people work for me. I was exposed to an environment that cultivated personal growth and encouraged personal best. 


Second: Loving People - There is something about being completely understaffed late at night after a Georgia/UT football game, on the verge of tears, and having a customer look at you with a smile and say "It's cool. I know you all are trying your best. Waiting 15 minutes for my food is fine". I discovered the basic fundamentals and importance of empathy in business. I felt the frustration that my co-workers felt when they were having a bad day and identified with my customers when all they needed is their caffeine fix from sweet tea. 


Third: I have a genetic disposition to being a workaholic. When I talk about strengths in my current role, I describe myself as a Drill Sergeant. I'm a responsible and disciplined achiever who likes consistency and harmony in life. Translation: I don't understand work life balance. I got so caught up with work in my marketing role at Chick-fil-a that I never seemed to be able to put my phone down. I was always monitoring our social media sites, and allowing some negative posts to affect me as a person. It took a 40 day fast from working at home and a whole lot of yoga for me to understand that work has it's place and time. I learned how to better organize my time, prioritize my daily goals instead of trying to achieve them all at once, and delegate tasks to others that wanted to help me. I also learned not to feel guilty about rest, it is just as productive for your mind and body as work is.    

### Where I am now
That brings us to another major fork in the road In 2013 that led me where I am today. My husband accepted a job at Rackspace in San Antonio, Texas and we we relocated 16 hours away from our hometown, our family, and our friends. I was faced with the challenge - did I want to stay on the path that I was on, well worn and easy. Did I want to continue to be a workaholic, always tired and smelly from being around the fryers in a Chick-fil-A kitchen? I reached completely outside of my comfort zone and went down the road less traveled with an overgrown path, tripping over sticks and weeds. I decided to explore opportunities at Rackspace for myself. Transparently, I was terrified. I never considered myself a technical mind, I left that up to my Linux admin of a husband. I started working in frontline support with email customers and built my empathy talents to new heights. I could see my previous self in the people I was helping as they were lost in confusion of trying to set up their email on their phones or Outlook. I learned to speak servers and cloud infrastructure with high spending customers, became intrigued with new technologies and took a deep dive into using tools that I never thought I would. 


What do I enjoy the most about where I am now? Looking back and realizing all those forks in the road that I crossed, and the lessons I learned along the way, shaped me into what I am today. I like to say I am a self-proclaimed service snob because I have come from two worlds, both very different in their products, but both treating the customer experience as the number one focus (which is still a new idea in the tech world). My customers were me back in the day, confused, frustrated and slightly intimidated by technology. My journey has taught me that the best way to work with those kinds people (my previous self) is to meet them where they are. I never thought I would be in support role, advising and helping customers make technology work for them and enabling them to be successful. It’s taken me to a place where I feel fulfilled, challenged daily, and get to hear people’s stories. I guess I could say that the road I took was less travelled and really has made all the difference.
