## My Thinking and Not Thinking Spaces

Yet another challenging post for me as part of the [Support Driven Writing Challenge](https://supportdriven.com/2016/10/21/stretch-your-typing-fingers-support-driven-6-week-writing-challenge/), because, and this is me being completely honest, I am not a fan of thinking spaces. As a recovering work-aholic and over achiever, thinking too much can cause anxiety for me. Don't get me wrong, I think it is important to plan, strategize and reflect. However, for me I need to have a defined time a place for those things balanced with a time when I don't have to think. Borrowing from [Gallup's Strengths Finder](http://strengths.gallup.com/default.aspx), welcome to the mind of a responsible, disciplined achiever that likes consistency and harmony.

# When I need to get it done 
I am my most effective in my "plugged in state". My noise cancelling headphones on, [Fall Morning](https://open.spotify.com/user/ashleysachs/playlist/1iLKmaqmrMFdiXr8gaWfk4) Spotify Playlist going (no matter what season), and a to do list in front of me. My most focused time outside of the work has to be in the sanctuary of a coffee shop. I don't know if it is the unlimited supply of caffiene, overwhelming feeling of intellect bustling around, or just simply that I won't be judged for being antisocial with my computer in front of me. Coffee shops allow me a place to disconnect and drown out the distractions around me.
